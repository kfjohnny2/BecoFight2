#BecoFight2

A simple point & click based on rounds fight game for the SENAC's Java Programmer School in 2012

## Gameplay

BecoFight is a fight game based on rounds made to play by 2 players. 
The players have 2 stats bar, "Vida" and "Força", where "Defesa" is the health of the player and "Força" is the Stamina that will be needed to make every hit. The stamina will decrease by every hit you make.

Each player will have 6 options of action, 2 of them are special: Hadouken(highest damage hit in the game) and Defesa (will rise your Força but you'll lose the round).


## Funcionality

- Button "Nomes": Change the players name;
- Button "Imagem P1", "Imagem P2": Put images to represent each player;
- Button "Música": Choose songs to play during the gameplay;
- Button "Iniciar": Start/restart the game.

## Problems

- Some SFX for the hit sounds are not beeing displayed, but it will be fixed in the next versions.

## Running

To run the you will have to extract the file "BecoFight-master", and enter the folder dist and run the BecoFight2.jar file.
